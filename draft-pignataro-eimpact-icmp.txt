                ICMP Extensions for Environmental Impact
                    draft-pignataro-eimpact-icmp-01

Abstract

   This document defines a data structure that can be appended to
   selected ICMP messages.  The ICMP extension defined herein can be
   used to gain visibility on environmental impact information on the
   Internet by providing per-hop (i.e., per topological network node)
   power metrics and other current or future sustainability metrics.
   This will contribute to achieving an objective mentioned in the IAB
   E-Impact workshop.

   The techniques presented are useful not only in a transactional
   setting (e.g., a user-issued traceroute or a ping request), but also
   in a scheduled automated setting where they may be run periodically
   in a mesh across an administrative domain to map out environmental-
   impact metrics.

1.  Introduction

   IP devices use the Internet Control Message Protocol ICMPv4 [RFC0792]
   and ICMPv6 [RFC4443] to convey control information to source hosts.
   In particular, when an IP device receives a datagram that it cannot
   process, it may send an ICMP message to the datagram's originator or
   source.  Network operators and higher-level protocols use these ICMP
   messages to detect and diagnose network issues.

   As the world transitions towards sustainability in technology, the
   focus is shifting not only on creating modern technologies infused
   with sustainability but also on bridging gaps in the tools that are
   already available, to enhance visibility, measurement, and
   quantification of their impact.  Consequently, tools which have been
   foundational for control and management for decades now encounter new
   requirements including enhancing them to cater to a significantly
   increasing demand for monitoring the sustainability and environmental
   impact.  This document serves that need by defining an ICMP extension
   object that appends environmental impact information to ICMP
   messages.

   Using the extension defined herein, a device can explicitly append
   these exemplary environmental impact metrics:

   *  Power metrics (e.g., time average, min/max)
   *  Electrical Energy Provider or Zone
   *  Geolocation
   *  Future sustainability metrics

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the following terms:

   ICMP:
      Generically referring to ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]
      messages.

   ICMP Extension:
      Extended ICMP to support multi-part messages through an ICMP
      extension structure, as defined in [RFC4884].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application

   The IAB held a workshop on "Environmental Impact of Internet
   Applications and Systems (eimpactws)" [IAB-EIMPACTWS], in which the
   need for visibility into environmental impact metrics within
   traditional Internet tools such as traceroute was highlighted (see
   WebVTT cue identifiers 139 and 140 of [IAB-EIMPACTWS-Minutes].)

   The Environmental Impact ICMP Extensions defined in this document
   allow for augmenting the traceroute output with environmental metrics
   from each reported node.

4.  ICMP Environmental Impact Extension

   This section defines the Environmental Impact Object, an ICMP
   extension object with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of TBA that
   can be appended to the following messages, as per [RFC4884] and
   [RFC8335]:

Internet-Draft          ICMP E-Impact Extensions           February 2024


   *  ICMPv4 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable
   *  ICMPv4 Parameter Problem
   *  ICMPv4 Extended Echo Reply [RFC8335]
   *  ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
   *  ICMPv6 Extended Echo Reply [RFC8335]

   The ICMP extension defined in this document MAY be appended to any of
   the above listed messages based on policy and following security
   considerations.

   These extensions are preceded by an ICMP Extension Structure Header,
   and include an ICMP Object Header.  Both are defined in [RFC4884].
   The same backward compatibility issues that apply to [RFC4884] apply
   to this extension.

   A single ICMP message can contain zero, one, or multiple instances of
   the Environmental Impact Object.  The C-Type further identifies the
   information fields carried.

   A single instance of the Environmental Impact Object can convey the
   following information from each reporting node: TODO FROM C-TYPE
   DEFINITION.

4.1.  Extension Format

   The ICMP Environmental Impact Extension has the following format.

                        1                   2                   3

      Checksum:
         The one's complement checksum of the ICMP extension [RFC4884].

   (2) Environmental Impact Object

      Length:
         Length of the object, including header and payload, in octets.

      Class-Num:
         TBA (Environmental Impact)

      C-Type:
         C-Type as explained in Section 4.2.

4.2.  C-Type Definition

   The 8-bit C-Type defined in the Section 8 of [RFC4884] allows to
   carry different information elements within this Class-Num (TBA).
   The techniques herein defined can be used with any specific e-impact
   metric in use, current or future.

   The ICMP Environmental Impact Extension Object header has the
   following format:

                          1                   2                   3

                      Figure 3: Power Extension Sub-Object

       A Class-Num of TBA and a C-Type of 1 are specified.  The returned
       power metric is a magnitude that may be directly displayed, and
       is expressed in Watts; one of the uses is having a traceroute or
       ping facility that shows per-hop power metrics.

   2.  Other metrics to be provided in subsequent revisions.

      |  TODO: It is important to note that there are various metrics
      |  that can be used.  We are starting with node-level metrics, and
      |  will move to component-level once node-level are somewhat
      |  stable.
      |  
      |  Under consideration (i.e., we heard these from reviewers or
      |  list) are
      |  
      |     a.  Energy per data transmitted
      |  
      |     b.  Average daily Power normalized to (i.e., divided by)
      |         maximum switching capacity of the node
      |  
      |     c.  Kw / Gbps without including optics
      |  
      |     d.  Power per packet / power per bype
      |  
      |     e.  Idle power
      |  
      |     f.  Node Capacity

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4884] and of [RFC8335] apply to
   these extensions.

   Upon receipt of an ICMP message, application software must check it
   for syntactic correctness.  The extension checksum MUST be verified.
   Care should be taken, as improperly specified length attributes and
   other syntax problems may result in buffer overruns.

   This document does not define the conditions under which a router
   sends an ICMP message.  Therefore, it does not expose routers to any
   new denial-of-service attacks.  Routers may need to limit the rate at
   which ICMP messages are sent.

   This document defines an extension that allows a router to append
   environmental impact information to multi-part ICMP messages, and
   therefore can provide the user of the traceroute and ping
   applications with additional metrics.

   The intended field of use for the extensions defined in this document
   is administrative debugging and troubleshooting and operational
   facilities.  The extensions herein defined supply additional
   information in ICMP responses.  These mechanisms are not initially
   intended for other uses.

Internet-Draft          ICMP E-Impact Extensions           February 2024


   Some of the additional metrics provided, as e.g., power draw
   information, have privacy considerations.  For example, behavioral
   considerations of the devices, or estimating other node and network
   attributes from the power or energy data.

   This document does not specify an authentication mechanism for the
   extension that it defines.  Application developers should be aware of
   various ICMP attacks [RFC5927].

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following object Class-num in the
   ICMP Extension Object Classes and Class Sub-types registry
   [IANA-ICMP-Extended]:

       +=============+=============================+===============+
       | Class Value | Class name                  | Reference     |
       +=============+=============================+===============+
       | TBA         | Environmental Impact Object | This document |
       +-------------+-----------------------------+---------------+

           Table 1: Class-num for Environmental Impact Extensions

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for the corresponding class
   sub-type (C-Type) space, as follows:

      +==============+==============================+===============+
      | C-Type Value | Description                  | Reference     |
      +==============+==============================+===============+
      | 0            | Reserved                     | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 1            | Power                        | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 2-246        | Unassigned                   |               |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 247-255      | Reserved for Experimentation | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+

            Table 2: C-Types for Environmental Impact Extensions

   C-Type values are assignable on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS)
   basis.
