             ICMP Extensions for Environmental Information
                    draft-pignataro-eimpact-icmp-03

Abstract

   This document defines a data structure that can be appended to
   selected ICMP messages.  The ICMP extension defined herein can be
   used to gain visibility on environmental impact information on the
   Internet by providing per-hop (i.e., per topological network node)
   power metrics and other current or future sustainability metrics.
   This will contribute to achieving an objective mentioned in the IAB
   E-Impact workshop.

   The techniques presented are useful not only in a transactional
   setting (e.g., a user-issued traceroute or a ping request), but also
   in a scheduled automated setting where they may be run periodically
   in a mesh across an administrative domain to map out environmental-
   impact metrics.

1.  Introduction

   IP devices use the Internet Control Message Protocol ICMPv4 [RFC0792]
   and ICMPv6 [RFC4443] to convey control information to source hosts.
   In particular, when an IP device receives a datagram that it cannot
   process, it may send an ICMP message to the datagram's originator or
   source.  Network operators and higher-level protocols use these ICMP
   messages to detect and diagnose network issues.

   As the world transitions towards sustainability in technology, the
   focus is shifting not only on creating modern technologies infused
   with sustainability but also on bridging gaps in the tools that are
   already available, to enhance visibility, measurement, and
   quantification of their impact.  Consequently, tools which have been

   foundational for control and management for decades now encounter new
   requirements including enhancing them to cater to a significantly
   increasing demand for monitoring the sustainability and environmental
   impact.  This document serves that need by defining an ICMP extension
   object that appends environmental impact information to ICMP
   messages.

   Using the extension defined herein, a device can explicitly append
   these exemplary environmental impact metrics for transmission across
   an administrative domain:

   *  Power metrics (e.g., time average, min/max)
   *  Electrical Energy Provider or Zone
   *  Geolocation
   *  Future sustainability metrics

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the following terms:

   ICMP:
      Generically referring to ICMPv4 [RFC0792] and ICMPv6 [RFC4443]
      messages.

   ICMP Extension:
      Extended ICMP to support multi-part messages through an ICMP
      extension structure, as defined in [RFC4884].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application

   The IAB held a workshop on "Environmental Impact of Internet
   Applications and Systems (eimpactws)" [IAB-EIMPACTWS], in which the
   need for visibility into environmental impact metrics within
   traditional Internet tools such as traceroute was highlighted (see
   WebVTT cue identifiers 139 and 140 of [IAB-EIMPACTWS-Minutes].)

   The Environmental Information ICMP Extensions defined in this
   document allow for augmenting the traceroute output with
   environmental metrics from each reported node.

4.  Transport Options for Sustainability Information

   To achieve the goal of transporting useful sustainability information
   across the network, there are two key considerations.  First, what
   information is useful to convey and in what format, and second, how
   to transport that sustainability information.

   For the first task, it is critical to normalize and agree upon the
   information to convey and format, across potentially multiple
   transports.

   For the second task, there is a variety of options available
   depending on use cases.  These can be categorized based on whether
   the approach is distributed (i.e., any endpoint or node can request
   and/or receive the sustainability information) or centralized (i.e.,
   a single 'controller' compiles and consolidates the information.)
   They can also be categorized based on the networking layer used
   (e.g., IP, like ICMP, or application, like SNMP).  Further, an
   existing protocol can be extended, or a brand new protocol can
   potentially be created for this purpose.

   This document builds upon a standardized, modular, backwards-
   compatible, and scale-proven ICMP extension [RFC4884].  This does not
   preclude the definition of other methods to transport sustainability
   information, more fitting to other use-cases.

5.  ICMP Environmental Information Extension

   This section defines the Environmental Information Object, an ICMP
   extension object with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of TBA that
   can be appended to the following messages, as per [RFC4884] and
   [RFC8335]:

   *  ICMPv4 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable
   *  ICMPv4 Parameter Problem
   *  ICMPv4 Extended Echo Reply [RFC8335]
   *  ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable
   *  ICMPv6 Extended Echo Reply [RFC8335]

   The ICMP extension defined in this document MAY be appended to any of
   the above listed messages based on policy and following security
   considerations.

Internet-Draft          ICMP E-Impact Extensions              April 2024


   These extensions are preceded by an ICMP Extension Structure Header,
   and include an ICMP Object Header.  Both are defined in [RFC4884].
   The same backward compatibility issues that apply to [RFC4884] apply
   to this extension.

   A single ICMP message can contain zero, one, or multiple instances of
   Environmental Information Objects.  The C-Type further identifies the
   information fields carried.

   A single instance of the Environmental Information Object can convey
   one of the information elements defined in Section 5.2 from each
   reporting node in an administrative domain.

5.1.  Extension Format

   The ICMP Environmental Information Extension has the following
   format.

                        1                   2                   3

         Length of the object, including header and payload, in octets.
         If there is no payload, the value of Length is 4.  This is used
         to convey that the object is unavailable (e.g., because the
         requested information is not applicable for the type of
         component that is being queried).

      Class-Num:
         TBA (Environmental Information)

      C-Type:
         C-Type as explained in Section 5.2.

      Object Payload:
         As defined by each C-Type.

   While there is a single ICMP Extension Header, there could be
   multiple Environmental Information Objects.

5.2.  C-Type Definition

   The 8-bit C-Type defined in the Section 8 of [RFC4884] allows to
   carry different information elements within this Class-Num (TBA).
   The techniques herein defined can be used with any specific e-impact
   metric in use, current or future.

   The ICMP Environmental Information Extension Object header has the
   following format:

                          1                   2                   3

       A Class-Num of TBA and a C-Type of 1 are specified.

       The Length is 8 if the object contains this payload.  A Length
       value of 4 indicates that it is unavailable.

       The Present Power is the node-level power being presently drawn,
       which is a magnitude that may be directly displayed, and is
       expressed in Watts (W).  A value of 0 indicates that the Present
       Power is not available.  The Idle Power is the node-level power
       when the node is idle.  A value of 0 indicates that the Idle
       Power is not available.

       The Length is 8 if the object contains this payload.  A Length
       value of 4 indicates that it is unavailable.

       The returned value is the node-level current throughput, which is
       a magnitude that may be directly displayed, and is expressed in
       bits-per-second (BPS).  This allows the recipient of the ICMP
       message to determine a relationship between power and traffic
       load.

       The Length is 8 if the object contains this payload.  A Length
       value of 4 indicates that it is unavailable.

       The returned value references an Ecolabels and Environmentally
       Relevant Certification (EERC) number.  The following EERC numbers
       are defined by the present specification:

       1.  ISO 14001:2015

       2.  TCO Certified

       3.  Energy-efficient ethernet

       A Class-Num of TBA and a C-Type of 5 are specified.

       The Length is 4 plus 20 times the number of elements included.  A
       Length value of 4 indicates that this object is unavailable.

       The returned value is one or more instances of component-level
       throughput.  Each instance is a set comprised by a UUID uniquely
       identifying the component, and the actual throughput of said
       component in bits-per-second (BPS).  This allows the recipient of
       the ICMP message to determine a relationship between power and
       traffic load.

6.  Sample Use Case

   The ICMP extension defined in this memo can be used to get
   sustainability metrics, either via a "transactional" or a "scheduled
   automated" fashion, inside an administrative domain.  Mentioned in
   this section is a sample "transactional" use case of how these
   metrics could be displayed to a user.  Since both traceroute and ping
   utilities are based on ICMP, we will use traceroute as an example.

   The flavor of traceroute that has been shown here supports the ICMP
   extensions and is capable of conveying to the end user the
   sustainability metrics in the extensions, along with the nodes that
   the original datagram visited on its way to the destination.  This
   traceroute is also backwards-compatible, i.e., it can also work well
   with those nodes which do not support these ICMP extensions.

   A user at a host with an IP address 198.51.100.27 executes a
   traceroute to 192.0.2.1 and the Figure 8 shows how the user can be
   presented with these metrics:

7.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of [RFC4884] and of [RFC8335] apply to
   these extensions.

   Upon receipt of an ICMP message, application software must check it
   for syntactic correctness.  The extension checksum MUST be verified.
   Care should be taken, as improperly specified length attributes and
   other syntax problems may result in buffer overruns.

   This document does not define the conditions under which a router
   sends an ICMP message.  Therefore, it does not expose routers to any
   new denial-of-service attacks.  Routers may need to limit the rate at
   which ICMP messages are sent.

   This document defines an extension that allows a router to append
   environmental impact information to multi-part ICMP messages in a
   single administrative domain, and therefore can provide the user of
   the traceroute and ping applications with additional metrics.

   The intended field of use for the extensions defined in this document
   is administrative debugging and troubleshooting and operational
   facilities.  The extensions herein defined supply additional
   information in ICMP responses.  These mechanisms are not initially
   intended for other uses.

   Some of the additional metrics provided, as e.g., power draw
   information, have privacy considerations.  For example, behavioral
   considerations of the devices, or estimating other node and network
   attributes from the power or energy data.  Other things like
   identification of the node, deducing node usage patterns are some
   more privacy concerns that can be related to the metrics.

   Keeping these considerations in mind, we limited the scope of the
   transportation of the sustainability metrics to a single
   administrative domain.  But, based on [RFC8799], limiting a protocols
   functionality doesn't mean that it will be secure.  So, this
   particular document, which defines "a modified ICMP message with
   sustainability metrics", can be classified as a FAIL-OPEN protocol
   [I-D.wkumari-intarea-safe-limited-domains].  That is, the interfaces
   of administrative domain border nodes, facing towards the open
   internet, can be configured such that they avoid leaking messages
   with extensions containing sustainability metrics, out of the AD.  To
   allow general ICMP messages, an administrator can configure those
   outward facing interfaces to not block/drop the entire message but
   only strip off the extension objects and only forward the ICMP
   message if it is destined to go out of the AD.

   When metrics are limited to the same AD, it can be considered that
   they can be generated from a valid source and will have integrity.

   This document does not specify an authentication mechanism for the
   extension that it defines.  Application developers should be aware of
   various ICMP attacks [RFC5927].
