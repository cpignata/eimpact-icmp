                 ICMP Extensions for Enronmental Impact
                    draft-pignataro-eimpact-icmp-00

Abstract

   This memo defines a data structure that can be appended to selected
   ICMP messages.  The ICMP extension defined herein can be used to gain
   visibility on "green-metrics" on the Internet by providing per-hop
   (e.g., per networking topological node) power metrics, estimated
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emission numbers, and potentially other current
   or future sustainability metrics.  This will help us get
   environmental and sustainability data and metadata hereby
   contributing to achieve an objective mentioned in the Internet
   Engineering Task Force (IETF) E-Impact initiative [IAB-EIMPACTWS].

   The techniques that is presented in this memo support a combination
   of both in-packet (e.g., ICMP extensions) and out-of-band (e.g.,
   external database lookup or application programming interface (API)
   calls from a host) methods that, together, yield the above-described
   new metrics.  These are useful not only in a transactional setting
   (e.g., a user- issued traceroute or a ping request) but also in a
   scheduled automated setting where they may be run periodically in a
   mesh across the Internet or across an administrative domain to map
   out environmental-impact metrics, including energy usage,
   (normalized) power, and estimated GHG emissions.

1.  Introduction

   IP devices use the Internet Control Message Protocol ICMPv4 [RFC0792]
   and ICMPv6 [RFC4443] to convey control information to source hosts.
   In particular, when an IP device receives a datagram that it cannot
   process, it may send an ICMP message to the datagram's originator or
   source.  Network operators and higher-level protocols use these ICMP
   messages to detect and diagnose network issues.

   As the world transitions towards sustainable technology, the focus is
   shifting not only on creating modern technologies infused with
   sustainability but also on bridging gaps in the tools that are
   already available; to enhance visibility, measurement, and
   quantification of their impact.  Consequently, these tools which have
   been foundational for control and management since over decades, now
   encounter new requirements including enhancing them to cater to a
   significantly increasing demand for tools dedicated to sustainability

   and environmental impact.  This memo aims to achieve that
   "enhancement" need by defining an ICMP extension object that appends
   sustainability information to ICMP messages.  ICMP messages MUST also
   include the IP header and leading payload octets of the original
   datagram.  And selected ICMP messages SHOULD include the "green-
   metrics".

   Using the extension defined herein, a device can explicitly append
   these exemplary "green-metrics":

   *  Power metrics [per-hop (e.g., per networking topological node) or
      per day]
   *  Power Provider or Zone
   *  Geolocation
   *  future sustainability metrics

   Some parts of the "green-metrics" will be presented using in-packet
   (in- the-wire) methods (e.g., ICMP extensions) plus out-of-band
   (e.g., out of band database lookup or application programming
   interface (API) calls from a host) methods that, together, yield the
   above-described new metrics.

   The ICMP extensions defined in this document must be preceded by an
   ICMP Extension Structure Header and an ICMP Object Header.  Both are
   defined in [RFC4884].  The same backward compatibility issues that
   apply to [RFC4884] apply to this extension.

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the following terms:

   ICMP:
      Generically referring to ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 messages.

   ICMP Extension:
      Extended ICMP to support multi-part messages through an ICMP
      extension structure, as defined in [RFC4884].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application

   The IAB held a workshop on "Environmental Impact of Internet
   Applications and Systems (eimpactws)" [IAB-EIMPACTWS], in which the
   need for visibility into environmental impact metrics within
   traditional Internet tools such as traceroute was highlighted (see
   WebVTT cue identifiers 139 and 140 of [IAB-EIMPACTWS-Minutes].)

   The Environmental Impact ICMP Extensions defined in this document
   allow for augmenting the traceroute output with environmental metrics
   from each reported node.

4.  ICMP Environmental Impact Extension

   This section defines the Environmental Impact Object, an ICMP
   extension object with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of TBA that
   can be appended to the following messages, as per [RFC4884]:

   *  ICMPv4 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable
   *  ICMPv4 Parameter Problem
   *  ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable

   The extension defined in this document MAY be appended to any of the
   above listed messages based on policy and following security
   considerations.

   A single ICMP message can contain exactly zero or one instances of
   the Environmental Impact Object.  The C-Type further identifies the
   information fields carried.

   A single instance of the Environmental Impact Object can convey the
   following information from each reporting node: TODO

4.1.  Extension Format

   The ICMP Environmental Impact Extension has the following format.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
   |Version|       Reserved        |           Checksum            |(1)

      C-Type:
         C-Type as explained in Section 4.2.

4.2.  C-Type Definition

   TODO: Explain C-Type

5.  Security Considerations

   Upon receipt of an ICMP message, application software must check it
   for syntactic correctness.  The extension checksum must be verified.
   Improperly specified length attributes and other syntax problems may
   result in buffer overruns.

   This memo does not define the conditions under which a router sends
   an ICMP message.  Therefore, it does not expose routers to any new
   denial-of-service attacks.  Routers may need to limit the rate at
   which ICMP messages are sent.

   This document defines an extension that allows a router to append
   sustainability information to multi-part ICMP messages, and therefore
   can provide the user of the TRACEROUTE/PING application with
   additional green-metrics.  This extension can also provide the user
   with additional out-of-band sustainability information that is not
   currently available.  This memo also doesn't address or define the
   security implications or flaws of the "out-of-band" methods that the
   router uses to fetch new sustainability information.  The security of
   that particular transaction will purely be based on the out-of-band
   method used in that transaction.

   One of the sub-objects allow the Geolocation details to be appended
   with the ICMP message.  This will potentially expose the physical
   location of the device.  But as this data is just transient, and used
   for fetching out-of-band metrics, it should not potentially be a
   secrurity issue as at the end all of this data is just used for
   administrative debugging and troubleshooting.

   The intended field of use for the extensions defined in this document
   is administrative debugging and troubleshooting.  The extensions
   herein defined supply additional information in ICMP responses.
   These mechanisms are not intended to be used in non-debugging
   applications.

   This document does not specify an authentication mechanism for the
   extension that it defines.  Application developers should be aware
   that ICMP messages and their contents are easily spoofed.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following object Class-num in the
   ICMP Extension Object Classes and Class Sub-types registry
   [IANA-ICMP-Extended]:

       +=============+=============================+===============+
       | Class Value | Class name                  | Reference     |
       +=============+=============================+===============+
       | TBA         | Environmental Impact Object | This document |
       +-------------+-----------------------------+---------------+

           Table 1: Class-num for Environmental Impact Extensions

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for the corresponding class
   sub-type (C-Type) space, as follows:

      +==============+==============================+===============+
      | C-Type Value | Description                  | Reference     |
      +==============+==============================+===============+
      | 0            | Reserved                     | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 1-246        | Unassigned                   |               |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 247-255      | Reserved for Experimentation | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+

            Table 2: C-Types for Environmental Impact Extensions

   C-Type values are assignable on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS)
   basis.
