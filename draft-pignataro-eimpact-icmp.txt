1.  Introduction

   Introduction Here...

2.  Conventions

2.1.  Definition of Terms

   This document uses the following terms:

   ICMP:
      Generically referring to ICMPv4 and ICMPv6 messages.

   ICMP Extension:
      Extended ICMP to support multi-part messages through an ICMP
      extension structure, as defined in [RFC4884].

2.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Application

   The IAB held a workshop on "Environmental Impact of Internet
   Applications and Systems (eimpactws)" [IAB-EIMPACTWS], in which the
   need for visibility into environmental impact metrics within
   traditional Internet tools such as traceroute was highlighted (see
   WebVTT cue identifiers 139 and 140 of [IAB-EIMPACTWS-Minutes].)

   The Environmental Impact ICMP Extensions defined in this document
   allow for augmenting the traceroute output with environmental metrics
   from each reported node.

4.  ICMP Extension

   This section defines the Environmental Impact Object, an ICMP
   extension object with a Class-Num (Object Class Value) of TBA that
   can be appended to the following messages, as per [RFC4884]:

   *  ICMPv4 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv4 Destination Unreachable
   *  ICMPv4 Parameter Problem
   *  ICMPv6 Time Exceeded
   *  ICMPv6 Destination Unreachable

   The extension defined in this document MAY be appended to any of the
   above listed messages based on policy and following security
   considerations.

   A single ICMP message can contain exactly zero or one instances of
   the Environmental Impact Object.  The C-Type further identifies the
   information fields carried.

   A single instance of the Environmental Impact Object can convey the
   following information from each reporting node: TODO

4.1.  Format

   The ICMP Environmental Impact Extension has the following format.

   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
   |Version|       Reserved        |           Checksum            |(1)
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+...
   |             Length            |   Class-Num   |   C-Type      |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+(2)
   ~                        Object payload                         ~

      Reserved:

      Checksum:
         The one's complement checksum of the ICMP extension [RFC4884].

   (2) Environmental Impact Object

      Length:
         Length of the object, including header and payload, in octets.

      Class-Num:
         TBA (Environmental Impact)

      C-Type:
         C-Type as explained below.

   TODO: Explain C-Type

5.  Security Considerations

   TBC.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to assign the following object Class-num in the
   ICMP Extension Object Classes and Class Sub-types registry
   [IANA-ICMP-Extended]:

       +=============+=============================+===============+
       | Class Value | Class name                  | Reference     |
       +=============+=============================+===============+
       | TBA         | Environmental Impact Object | This document |
       +-------------+-----------------------------+---------------+

           Table 1: Class-num for Environmental Impact Extensions

   IANA is requested to establish a registry for the corresponding class
   sub-type (C-Type) space, as follows:

      +==============+==============================+===============+
      | C-Type Value | Description                  | Reference     |
      +==============+==============================+===============+
      | 0            | Reserved                     | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 1-246        | Unassigned                   |               |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+
      | 247-255      | Reserved for Experimentation | This document |
      +--------------+------------------------------+---------------+

            Table 2: C-Types for Environmental Impact Extensions

   C-Type values are assignable on a first-come-first-serve (FCFS)
   basis.
